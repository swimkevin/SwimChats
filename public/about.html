                <p>
                    I am currently a freshmen at the University of Maryland after swimming for 12 years on RMSC since I
                    was 6 years old. I ended up making the 2018 Speedo Junior National Championships but decided to
                    just swim club in college and focus on my education. Feel free to share your story and experiences
                    to give others advice and tips on how to improve and stay motivated. I will also continue to update
                    the site and resolve any problems that may occur on the site. I also keep your privacy by allowing
                    users to stay anonymous on the site and do not store any of your data.

                    Sharing practice sets, technique tips and videos are all encouraged in the chat. Get and receive
                    advice before the big meet and remember to be respectful and have fun!

                    <p>
                        We want to encourage swimmers to share information, ideas, and get
                        to know other swimmers from across the Country. We make it easy for swimmers across the country
                        to go onto a platform where they can share ideas and information easily in realtime as well as
                        receive updated tips and advice.
