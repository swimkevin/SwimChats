                <p>
                    <b>Freestyle Tips:</b> Keep your stroke long and reach all the way in front of you. When you pull, don't pull with a straight arm. Bend your arms like you are recovering with a high elbow when you pull and make sure you pull all the way back past your hips before you recover. For head position, don't look straight down. Keep your head slightly forward so you can turn and breathe faster and more natural.

                <p>
                    <b>Backstroke Tips:</b> Keep your head back and try to move your head as little as possible. A useful drill to practice this is trying to balance a water bottle on your forehead and attempt to swim your normal backstorke stroke while keeping the water bottle balanced and not moving. Another tip most backstrokers need to work on is spinning their arms faster without over rotating their shoulders.

                <p>
                    <b>Breastroke Tips:</b> Professional breastrokers now have a trend of a more narrow kick. Narrow kicks allow for breaststrokers to push themselves forward faster with quicker stroke counts. The recovery is also really fast which means you have to push your arms forward as fast as possible. A good example of this technique is Adam Peaty who is the world's fastest sprint breaststrokers and Lilly King, the fastest female sprint breaststroker.

                <p>
                    <b>Butterfly Tips:</b> Lift your chin up when you breathe and stay low, right at the surface of the water. Focus on getting your rhythem right by breathing right when you finish your stroke. Most of your energy and movement should come from the hips so your arms don't waste energy, they should follow your hips.
