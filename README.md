# SwimChats
My Start-Up Website where I implement a chat program, forum, and article pages for swimmers.

Hello Everyone, I am creating a website where I can connect swimmers from across the U.S. and allow them to share their experiences and tips with each other. This is also a great way for swimmers to get to know each other better and stay motivated. 

All html files are under the public folder. Right now, I have finished the basic layouts of the website and the chat program is working. I do need help creating a forum page and fixing the socket.io chat page so that it can clear the chat history once in a while. I am also new to web development so all help would be appreciated.

I used node.js, mongoDB, javascript, html, and css. All you need to do is go to localhost:3000 to begin to see the site. You will still need to install any node and mongoDB if you don't have it.

"npm run dev" is how you will run the program in development mode.
